# Learn to Code Rust by Making Games

Welcome to the repository for Brooks Build's tutorial on learning to code [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) by making games. The code for this tutorial is open source and under the [MIT license](LICENSE). 

## How This Works

Learning a new programming language can be difficult, especially if you only know one language. I have a plan to make learning both fun and well...informative. I am going to take you on a programming learning journey by making three games. First in JavaScript using [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) as the game engine. Then I'm going to make the same game again in Rust and the [GGEZ](https://ggez.rs/) game engine. All along the way I'll be showing off language features as we build, and then refactor the games. By the end of the series you'll have three games that you can use as a reference as you continue on your Rusty journey.

Why use a game engine? I want to show off the language, not spend a lot of time dealing with low level graphics processing. P5.js is a great JavaScript library that has a lot of similarities to GGEZ, which is why it's perfect to use for this case.

## Prerequisites

I recommend that you are familiar with JavaScript in order to get the most out of this course. I'm expecting that you have the experience of a college or code school graduate. No Rust experience is necessary.

## Companion Videos

All the code written in this repository will be / was live streamed on [Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/brookzerker). The streams remain on Twitch.tv for two weeks before they are automatically removed. I will not be archiving these videos to YouTube like other streams as I'm creating a paid course on Teachable with this content.

## Teachable Course

Current Course Status: Pre Alpha

I will be cutting the live streams into shorter videos and making them available on Teachable as part of a course.

As this is a new course for myself I will be releasing access in incremental tiers. We'll stay in beta until all of the content for the course has been released and we make sure that the content is up to my standards.

If you purchase the course during the beta release cycles I'll be asking you to give me feedback as I build out the course so that I can make it as amazing as possible. When the course releases fully there won't be any extra fees, you'll have access to the course for as long as Teachable exists. I'm using them to host my content so that I don't have to build my own learning management system. I'm hoping that they will remain in business for a very long time.
