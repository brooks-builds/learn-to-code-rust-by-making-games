# Learn to Code Rust by Making Games

Welcome to the repository for Brooks Build's tutorial on learning to code [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) by making games. The code for this tutorial is open source and under the [MIT license](LICENSE). 

## How This Works

Learning a new programming language can be difficult, especially if you only know one language. I have a plan to make learning both fun and well...informative. I am going to take you on a programming learning journey by making three games. First in JavaScript using [P5.js](https://p5js.org/) as the game engine. Then I'm going to make the same game again in Rust and the [GGEZ](https://ggez.rs/) game engine. All along the way I'll be showing off language features as we build, and then refactor the games. By the end of the series you'll have three games that you can use as a reference as you continue on your Rusty journey.

Why use a game engine? I want to show off the language, not spend a lot of time dealing with low level graphics processing. P5.js is a great JavaScript library that has a lot of similarities to GGEZ, which is why it's perfect to use for this case.

## Prerequisites

I recommend that you are familiar with JavaScript in order to get the most out of this course. I'm expecting that you have the experience of a college or code school graduate. No Rust experience is necessary.

## Companion Videos

All the code written in this repository will be / was live streamed on [Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/brookzerker). The streams remain on Twitch.tv for two weeks before they are automatically removed. I will not be archiving these videos to YouTube like other streams as I'm a Patreon account to host the archive videos on.

## How I choose the games

I currently don't have a way to request what you want to see, instead I am creating a list of fun projects that I feel help stave off burnout while at the same time increasing our knowledge of languages and programming in general.

## Where the code will live

I'll be creating GitHub repositories for each tutorial as I make them. They will always be open source, so even if you aren't paying for the video archives, you can download the code and look through them.
