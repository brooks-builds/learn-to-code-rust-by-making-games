# Learn to Code Rust by Making Games

Welcome to the repository for Brooks Build's tutorial on learning to code [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) by making games. The code for this tutorial is open source and under the [MIT license](LICENSE). 

## Companion Videos

All the code written in this repository will be / was live streamed on [Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/brookzerker). The streams remain on Twitch.tv for two weeks before they are automatically removed. I will not be archiving these videos to YouTube like other streams as I'm creating a paid course on Teachable with this content.

## Teachable Course

Current Course Status: Not Ready

I will be cutting the live streams into shorter videos and making them available on Teachable as part of a course.

As this is a new course for myself I will be releasing access in incrementing payment tiers. We'll stay in beta until all of the content for the course has been released and we make sure that the content is up to my standards.

### Payment Tiers

* TBD  - Pre-beta (this is before any content has been created besides the introduction video)
* TBD  - Beta (this is after the first game has been released)
* TBD  - Beta (After the second game)
* TBD  - Release (After all content is available)
